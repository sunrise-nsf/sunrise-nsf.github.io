### High-resolution nested TXLA model
Daijiro Kobashi and Rob Hetland developed a two-way nested grid of the TXLA model that has roughly five times the resolution as the parent grid. The figure below shows snapshots of the surface vertical vorticity field. Look at all the structure that pops up inside the box!

### Near-inertial wave critical layers
Leif Thomas, Lixin Qu, and Jamie Hilditch have been examining slantwise critical layers over the TXLA shelf, which have been shown to enhance mixing. The figure below demonstrates evidence and processes associated with slantwise critical layers in both the TXLA model and idealized shelf simulations.
